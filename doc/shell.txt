*shell.txt*  Improved integration between Vim and its environment

This plug-in aims to improve the integration between Vim and its environment
(your operating system) by providing the following functionality:

 - The |:Fullscreen| command and '<F11>' mapping toggle Vim between normal and
   full-screen mode (see the screenshots [1]). To invoke this functionality
   without using the |:Fullscreen| command see the 'xolox#shell#fullscreen()'
   and 'xolox#shell#is_fullscreen()' functions.

 - The |:Maximize| command and '<Control-F11>' mapping toggle Vim between
   normal and maximized state: They show/hide Vim's menu bar, tool bar and/or
   tab line without hiding the operating system task bar.

 - The |:Open| command and '<F6>' mapping know how to open file and directory
   names, URLs and e-mail addresses in your favorite programs (file manager,
   web browser, e-mail client, etc). To invoke this functionality without
   using the |:Open| command see my open.vim [2] plug-in, which was split off
   from 'shell.vim' so that other Vim plug-ins can bundle it without bringing
   in all the other crap :-).

 - The 'xolox#shell#execute()' function enables other Vim plug-ins (like my
   easytags.vim [3] plug-in) to execute external commands in the background
   (i.e. asynchronously) without opening a command prompt window on Windows.

Two Windows DLL files [4] are included to perform these functions on Windows,
while on UNIX external commands are used.

Usage (commands & functions) ~

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:Maximize* command

This command toggles the visibility of Vim's main menu, tool bar and/or tab
line. It's mapped to '<Control-F11>' by default, see |g:shell_mappings_enabled|
if you don't like this. If you want to change which items are hidden see the
|g:shell_fullscreen_items| option.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:Fullscreen* command

The |:Fullscreen| command toggles Vim between normal and full-screen mode [1].
It's mapped to '<F11>' by default, see |g:shell_mappings_enabled| if you don't
like this. This command first executes |:Maximize| and then (if possible)
switches Vim's |GUI| window to real full-screen mode (hiding any taskbars,
panels or docks [5]). When you leave full-screen Vim's main menu, toolbar and
tabline are restored and the |GUI| window is switched back to normal mode.

Note that on UNIX this command even works inside of graphical terminal
emulators like 'gnome-terminal' or 'xterm' (try it out!).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *:Open* command

The |:Open| command knows how to open files, directories, URLs and e-mail
addresses. It's mapped to '<F6>' by default, see |g:shell_mappings_enabled| if
you don't like this. You can provide a filename, URL or e-mail address as
argument to the command or if there's a filename, URL or e-mail address under
the text cursor that will be used. If both of those fail, the directory
containing the current file will be opened. You can use the command as
follows:
>
    :Open http://www.vim.org/

This will launch your preferred (or the best available) web browser. Likewise
the following command will open your file manager in the directory of Vim's
runtime files:
>
    :Open $VIMRUNTIME

Note that on UNIX if the environment variable '$DISPLAY' is empty the plug-in
will fall back to a command-line web browser. Because such web browsers are
executed in front of Vim you have to quit the web browser to return to Vim.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *xolox#shell#execute()* function

This function enables other Vim plug-ins to execute external commands in the
background (i.e. asynchronously) without opening a command prompt window on
Windows. For example try to execute the following command on Windows
(vimrun.exe (see |win32-vimrun|) is only included with Vim for Windows because
it isn't needed on other platforms):
>
    :call xolox#shell#execute('vimrun', 0)

Immediately after executing this command Vim will respond to input again
because 'xolox#shell#execute()' doesn't wait for the external command to
finish when the second argument is false (0). In addition no command prompt
window will be shown which means vimrun.exe (see |win32-vimrun|) is running
completely invisible in the background. When the second argument is true (1)
the output of the command will be returned as a list of lines, otherwise true
(1) is returned unless an error occurred, in which case false (0) is returned.

If you want to verify that this function works as described, open the Windows
task manager by pressing 'Control-Shift-Escape' and check that the process
'vimrun.exe' is listed in the processes tab. If you don't see the problem this
is solving, try executing vimrun.exe (see |win32-vimrun|) using Vim's built-in
|system()| function instead:
>
    :call system('vimrun')

Vim will be completely unresponsive until you "press any key to continue" in
the command prompt window that's running vimrun.exe (see |win32-vimrun|). Now of
course the |system()| function should only be used with non-interactive programs
(the documentation says as much) but my point was to simulate an external
command that takes a while to finish and blocks Vim while doing so.

Note that on Windows this function uses Vim's |'shell'| and |'shellcmdflag'|
options to compose the command line passed to the DLL.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *xolox#shell#fullscreen()* function

Call this function to toggle Vim's full screen status. The |:Fullscreen|
command is just a shorter way to call this function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *xolox#shell#is_fullscreen()* function

Call this function to determine whether Vim is in full screen mode. My
session.vim plug-in [6] uses this to persist full screen mode.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:shell_fullscreen_items* option

This variable is a string containing any combination of the following
characters:

 - 'm': Hide the main menu (see |'go-m'|) when switching to full-screen;

 - 'T': Hide the toolbar (see |'go-T'|) when switching to full-screen;

 - 'e': Hide the tabline (see |'go-e'|) when switching to full-screen (this also
   toggles the showtabline option (see |'showtabline'|)).

By default all the above items are hidden in full-screen mode. You can also
set the buffer local variable 'b:shell_fullscreen_items' to change these
settings for specific buffers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:shell_mappings_enabled* option

If you don't like the default mappings for the |:Open| and |:Fullscreen|
commands then add the following to your |vimrc| script:
>
    :let g:shell_mappings_enabled = 0

Since no mappings will be defined now you can add something like the following
to your |vimrc| script:
>
    :inoremap <Leader>fs <C-o>:Fullscreen<CR>
    :nnoremap <Leader>fs :Fullscreen<CR>
    :inoremap <Leader>op <C-o>:Open<CR>
    :nnoremap <Leader>op :Open<CR>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The *g:shell_verify_urls* option

When you use the |:Open| command or the '<F6>' mapping to open the URL under
the text cursor, the shell plug-in uses a regular expression to guess where
the URL starts and ends. This works 99% percent of the time but it can break,
because in this process the shell plug-in will strip trailing punctuation
characters like dots (because they were likely not intended to be included in
the URL).

If you actually deal with URLs that include significant trailing punctuation
and your Vim is compiled with Python support you can enable the option
|g:shell_verify_urls| (by setting it to 1 in your |vimrc| script). When you do
this the plug-in will perform an HTTP HEAD request on the URL without
stripping trailing punctuation. If the request returns an HTTP status code
that indicates some form of success (the status code is at least 200 and less
than 400) the URL including trailing punctuation is opened. If the HEAD
request fails the plug-in will try again without trailing punctuation.

Background ~

Vim has a limited ability to call external libraries using the Vim script
function |libcall()|. A few years ago when I was still using Windows a lot I
created a Windows DLL [4] that could be used with |libcall()| to toggle Vim's
GUI window between regular and full-screen mode. I also added a few other
useful functions, e.g. 'openurl()' to launch the default web browser and
'execute()' which works like Vim's |system()| function but doesn't wait for the
process to finish and doesn't show a command prompt.

Since then I switched to Linux and didn't look back, which meant the DLL sat
in my '~/.vim/etc/' waiting to be revived. Now that I've published my
easytags.vim [3] plug-in and put a lot of effort into making it Windows
compatible, the 'execute()' function from the DLL would be very useful to run
Exuberant Ctags [7] in the background without stealing Vim's focus by opening
a command prompt window. This is why I've decided to release the DLL. Because
I switched to Linux I've also added an autoload script that wraps the DLL on
Windows and calls out to external programs such as 'wmctrl', 'gnome-open',
'kde-open', and others on UNIX.

Before I go ahead and bundle the DLL files with my easytags.vim [3] plug-in I
need to make sure they're compatible with as many Windows Vim installations
out there as possible, e.g. XP/Vista/7, different service packs, 32/64 bits,
etc. I've uploaded a ZIP archive including two compiled DLL files [8] to the
Vim scripts page [9] for this plug-in (build using the latest Windows SDK but
targeting Windows XP x86/x64 RELEASE, should also work on Vista/7) and the
source code is available in the GitHub repository [10] (there's also a Batch
script [11] with compile instructions).

Other full-screen implementations ~

After publishing this plug-in I found that the Vim plug-ins VimTweak [12] and
gvimfullscreen_win32 [13] also implement full-screen on Windows using a
similar approach as my plug-in. I prefer the effect of my plug-in because it
seems to hide window decorations more effectively. Also note that my plug-in
was developed independently of the other two.
